# drum-machine

All the code is in DrumMachineFX/src/sample. To run the code, download an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse. Open the project in the IDE, and navigate to
drum-machine/DrumMachineFX/src/sample/Main.java. Change the baseFile variable to the string containing the absolute path to drum-machine/src. Don't forget to use \\ instead of \, since Java requires you to \\ twice to put \ in a string. For example, my absolute path is
C:\Users\Jeffrey Li\drum-machine\src\. However, when you set it equal to the baseFile variable, you have to add an extra \ for every single \ you have.
So my baseFile would be equal to "C:\\Users\\Jeffrey Li\\drum-machine\\src\\". Please email me at lijw@berkeley.edu if you have any issues.
